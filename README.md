cic-emacs-config: A collection of personal Emacs configuration files
====================================================================

This package provides the specific Emacs configuration that I
(akroshko) use.  Although this code is specific to my configuration,
it is provided because it may be useful to others who wish to use
Emacs in similar ways to what I do.
